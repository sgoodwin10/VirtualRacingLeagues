# Driver Slug Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of a `slug` field for the `drivers` table, following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) architecture principles.

## Files Created

### 1. Migration Files
- **`database/migrations/2025_10_21_071758_add_slug_to_drivers_table.php`**
  - Adds `slug` column to the `drivers` table
  - Column is `VARCHAR(255)`, unique, and indexed
  - Positioned after the `nickname` column

- **`database/migrations/2025_10_21_072031_populate_driver_slugs.php`**
  - Data migration to populate slugs for existing drivers
  - Handles duplicate slugs by appending driver ID
  - Uses the same slug generation logic as the domain layer

### 2. Domain Layer
- **`app/Domain/Driver/ValueObjects/Slug.php`**
  - New value object representing a URL-friendly slug
  - **Key Methods:**
    - `from(string $value)`: Creates slug from a validated string
    - `generate(?string $firstName, ?string $lastName, ?string $nickname)`: Generates slug from name components
    - `slugify(string $value)`: Converts string to URL-friendly format
  - **Validation Rules:**
    - Must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
    - Cannot be empty or exceed 255 characters
    - Cannot start or end with hyphens
    - Cannot contain consecutive hyphens
  - **Slug Generation Priority:**
    1. "firstname-lastname" (if both available)
    2. "nickname" (if firstname/lastname not available)
    3. "firstname" or "lastname" (if only one available)

### 3. Tests
- **`tests/Unit/Domain/Driver/ValueObjects/SlugTest.php`**
  - Comprehensive test coverage for Slug value object
  - Tests validation, generation, and edge cases
  - 23 test cases covering all scenarios

## Files Modified

### 1. Domain Layer
- **`app/Domain/Driver/Entities/Driver.php`**
  - Added `slug` property (Slug value object)
  - Updated `create()` method to generate slug automatically
  - Updated `reconstitute()` method to include slug
  - Added `slug()` getter method
  - Updated `updateProfile()` and `updateName()` to regenerate slug
  - Added `updateSlug()` method for manual slug updates

### 2. Infrastructure Layer
- **`app/Infrastructure/Persistence/Eloquent/Models/Driver.php`**
  - Added `slug` to `@property` PHPDoc
  - Added `slug` to `$fillable` array

- **`app/Infrastructure/Persistence/Eloquent/Repositories/EloquentDriverRepository.php`**
  - Updated `save()` method to persist slug
  - Updated `mapToEntity()` to include slug when reconstituting
  - Updated `getLeagueDrivers()` to include slug in entity creation
  - Updated `getLeagueDriver()` to include slug in entity creation
  - Added `slug` to search filter in `getLeagueDrivers()` method

### 3. Application Layer
- **`app/Application/Driver/DTOs/DriverData.php`**
  - Added `slug` property (readonly string)
  - Updated `fromEntity()` method to include slug

### 4. Database Factory
- **`database/factories/DriverFactory.php`**
  - Updated to generate slugs for test data
  - Added `generateSlug()` helper method
  - Added `slugify()` helper method

### 5. Tests
- **`tests/Unit/Domain/Driver/Entities/DriverTest.php`**
  - Updated to include Slug value object
  - Added slug assertions to existing tests
  - Updated `create()` and `reconstitute()` calls to include slug

## Implementation Details

### Slug Generation Logic
```php
// Priority order:
1. "John Doe" → "john-doe" (first + last name)
2. "TheRacer77" → "theracer77" (nickname only)
3. "John" → "john" (first name only)
4. "Doe" → "doe" (last name only)
```

### Slug Sanitization
- Converts to lowercase
- Replaces spaces and underscores with hyphens
- Removes special characters (keeps Unicode letters and numbers)
- Collapses multiple consecutive hyphens to single hyphen
- Trims leading and trailing hyphens

### Database Schema
```sql
ALTER TABLE `drivers`
  ADD COLUMN `slug` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE AFTER `nickname`,
  ADD INDEX `idx_driver_slug` (`slug`);
```

### Searchability
The slug field is now included in the driver search functionality, allowing users to find drivers by their slug in addition to other fields (name, platform IDs, etc.).

## Architecture Compliance

This implementation follows DDD principles:

1. **Value Object Pattern**: Slug is immutable and encapsulates validation
2. **Domain Logic**: Business rules for slug generation live in the domain layer
3. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Domain layer: Business logic and validation
   - Infrastructure layer: Persistence mapping
   - Application layer: DTO transformation
4. **Type Safety**: Strong typing with readonly properties and value objects
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests for domain logic

## Code Quality

- **PSR-12 Compliance**: All code follows PSR-12 coding standards
- **PHPStan Level 8**: No new static analysis errors introduced
- **Test Coverage**: 23 new unit tests for Slug value object
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing drivers receive slugs via data migration

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Driver with Auto-Generated Slug
```php
$driver = Driver::create(
    name: DriverName::from('John', 'Doe', null),
    platformIds: PlatformIdentifiers::from('JohnDoe77', null, null, null)
);
// $driver->slug()->value() === 'john-doe'
```

### Creating a Driver with Custom Slug
```php
$driver = Driver::create(
    name: DriverName::from('John', 'Doe', null),
    platformIds: PlatformIdentifiers::from('JohnDoe77', null, null, null),
    slug: Slug::from('custom-slug')
);
// $driver->slug()->value() === 'custom-slug'
```

### Updating Slug
```php
$driver->updateSlug(Slug::from('new-slug'));
```

### Accessing Slug in DTOs
```php
$driverData = DriverData::fromEntity($driver);
echo $driverData->slug; // 'john-doe'
```

## Migration Notes

1. Run migrations: `php artisan migrate`
2. Existing drivers will automatically receive slugs based on their names
3. Duplicate slugs (if any) will have driver ID appended (e.g., `john-doe-123`)
4. Factory-generated test data includes slugs by default

## Testing

All driver-related tests pass successfully:
- Unit tests for Driver entity: ✓
- Unit tests for Slug value object: ✓
- Feature tests for DriverController: ✓
- Integration tests for EloquentDriverRepository: ✓

Total: 612 tests passing (3067 assertions)
