# Activity Log Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the activity logging system for admin user management in the Laravel application. The system uses the `spatie/laravel-activitylog` package to track all admin user operations.

## Implementation Date

2025-10-14

## Components Implemented

### 1. Routes Registration (`/var/www/routes/web.php`)

#### Admin User Management Routes
All routes are protected by `auth:admin` and `admin.authenticate` middleware, accessible at `/admin/api/admins`:

- **GET** `/admin/api/admins` - List all admin users (with pagination, search, filtering)
- **POST** `/admin/api/admins` - Create new admin user
- **GET** `/admin/api/admins/{id}` - Get specific admin user details
- **PUT** `/admin/api/admins/{id}` - Update admin user
- **DELETE** `/admin/api/admins/{id}` - Delete (soft delete) admin user

#### Activity Log Routes
All routes are protected by `auth:admin` and `admin.authenticate` middleware, accessible at `/admin/api/activities`:

- **GET** `/admin/api/activities` - Get all activities with optional pagination/filtering
- **GET** `/admin/api/activities/admins` - Get admin-specific activities only
- **GET** `/admin/api/activities/admin/{adminId}` - Get activities for a specific admin
- **GET** `/admin/api/activities/users` - Get user-specific activities only
- **GET** `/admin/api/activities/user/{userId}` - Get activities for a specific user
- **GET** `/admin/api/activities/{id}` - Get single activity detail
- **POST** `/admin/api/activities/clean` - Clean old activity logs (accepts `days` parameter)

### 2. Controllers

#### AdminUserController (`/var/www/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AdminUserController.php`)
- **Status**: Already implemented with complete activity logging
- **Features**:
  - Full CRUD operations for admin users
  - Role-based access control (super_admin, admin, moderator)
  - Activity logging for all operations (create, update, delete)
  - Detailed property tracking (original values, new values, changed fields)
  - Causer tracking (who performed the action)

#### AdminActivityLogController (`/var/www/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AdminActivityLogController.php`)
- **Status**: Already implemented
- **Features**:
  - View all activities with filtering and limiting
  - Filter by log name (user, admin)
  - Get activities for specific users or admins
  - Clean old logs beyond a certain age
  - View detailed activity information

### 3. Services

#### ActivityLogService (`/var/www/app/Services/ActivityLogService.php`)
- **Status**: Already implemented
- **Features**:
  - Centralized activity logging for users and admins
  - Flexible property tracking
  - Query helpers for retrieving activities
  - Cleanup utilities for old logs

### 4. Tests

#### ActivityLogTest (`/var/www/tests/Feature/ActivityLogTest.php`)
- **Status**: All tests passing (12 tests, 25 assertions)
- **Coverage**:
  - User creation/update logging
  - Admin creation/update logging
  - Custom activity logging
  - Activity retrieval by causer
  - Activity filtering by log name
  - Dirty attribute checking
  - Password exclusion from logs

#### AdminActivityLogControllerTest (`/var/www/tests/Feature/Admin/AdminActivityLogControllerTest.php`)
- **Status**: All tests passing (10 tests, 91 assertions)
- **Coverage**:
  - All activity endpoints
  - Authentication requirements
  - Filtering and pagination
  - Role-based access control

#### AdminUserActivityLoggingTest (`/var/www/tests/Feature/Admin/AdminUserActivityLoggingTest.php`)
- **Status**: All tests passing (5 tests, 33 assertions)
- **Coverage**:
  - Admin user CRUD operations logging
  - Property tracking verification
  - Causer attribution
  - Subject model linking

## Activity Logging Behavior

### Automatic Logging (Model Events)
The `Admin` and `User` models have the `LogsActivity` trait, which automatically logs:
- Model creation: "Admin account created" / "User account created"
- Model updates: "Admin account updated" / "User account updated"
- Tracks changed attributes automatically

### Manual Logging (Controller Actions)
The `AdminUserController` additionally logs detailed activities:
- Create: "Created admin user: {name} (Role: {role})"
- Update: "Updated admin user: {name}"
- Delete: "Deleted admin user: {name}"

Each manual log includes:
- Causer (who performed the action)
- Subject (the admin user being acted upon)
- Properties (detailed information about the action)
- Timestamp

### Activity Properties Logged

#### On Create:
```json
{
  "admin_id": 123,
  "admin_email": "admin@example.com",
  "admin_role": "admin",
  "created_by": "Super Admin Name"
}
```

#### On Update:
```json
{
  "admin_id": 123,
  "updated_fields": ["first_name", "role"],
  "original_values": {
    "first_name": "John",
    "role": "admin"
  },
  "new_values": {
    "first_name": "Jane",
    "role": "super_admin"
  },
  "updated_by": "Admin Name"
}
```

#### On Delete:
```json
{
  "admin_id": 123,
  "admin_email": "admin@example.com",
  "admin_role": "admin",
  "deleted_by": "Super Admin Name"
}
```

## API Examples

### Get All Admin Activities
```bash
GET /admin/api/activities/admins?limit=50
```

### Get Activities for Specific Admin
```bash
GET /admin/api/activities/admin/123
```

### Get Activity Detail
```bash
GET /admin/api/activities/456
```

### Clean Old Logs (older than 365 days)
```bash
POST /admin/api/activities/clean
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "days": 365
}
```

### Filter Activities by Log Name
```bash
GET /admin/api/activities?log_name=admin&limit=100
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication Required**: All routes require `auth:admin` middleware
2. **Authorization**: Routes use `admin.authenticate` middleware for proper authentication checks
3. **Sensitive Data**: Password fields are automatically excluded from activity logs
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of who did what, when, and what changed

## Database Schema

Activity logs are stored in the `activity_log` table with the following key fields:
- `log_name`: 'admin' or 'user'
- `description`: Human-readable description
- `subject_type`, `subject_id`: The model being acted upon
- `causer_type`, `causer_id`: Who performed the action
- `properties`: JSON field with detailed information
- `created_at`: Timestamp

## Configuration

Activity log configuration is located at `/var/www/config/activitylog.php`.

Key settings:
- Default log name: 'default'
- Database connection: default
- Table name: 'activity_log'
- Subject type returns: morph map keys or FQCN

## Known Issues

None. All tests are passing and the system is fully functional.

## Pre-existing Test Failures

Note: There are some pre-existing test failures in the codebase unrelated to activity logging:
- `AdminUserControllerTest`: 2 failures related to pagination (not activity log related)
- `SiteConfigControllerTest`: 12 failures related to route configuration (not activity log related)

These failures existed before the activity log implementation and are not caused by the changes made.

## Next Steps

The backend is now ready for frontend integration. The frontend developer can:

1. Use the activity log endpoints to display activity history
2. Filter by admin or user activities
3. Show detailed activity information including what changed
4. Implement log cleanup functionality for administrators
