I want to update the layout of @resources/app/js/components/round/modals/RoundFormDrawer.vue

At the top:
round number (the only required field) and round name in a row the whole width.
round number will take 20% and round name will take 80%

Then i want to have a hide / show feature (Accordion) for the rest of the form, and the label being `More Information`.

below that, 2 columns
left 66%:
track will be full width and below will be track conditions and layout on the one row.

right 33%:
schedule date and time
stream url

below that will will be a horizontal rule
left will be 66%
technical notes

right will be internal notes.

use @dev-fe-app
