## Best Practices

### When to Create Users
- Manual registration by admin
- Bulk import scenarios
- Testing purposes
- Special access requirements

### When to Deactivate Users
- User requested account closure
- Violation of terms of service
- Inactive accounts (after warning)
- Security concerns

### When to Suspend Users
- Temporary ban for rule violations
- Investigation pending
- Payment issues (if applicable)
- Short-term access restriction

### When to Restore Users
- Issue resolved
- Ban period expired
- Mistake in deactivation
- User requested reactivation

## Troubleshooting

### "Email has already been taken"
- Another user already has this email
- Check if a soft-deleted user has this email
- Use search to find the existing user

### User List Not Loading
- Check your authentication status
- Ensure you have admin permissions
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend API is running

### Changes Not Saving
- Check validation errors (red text in form)
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Verify password meets minimum length (8 chars)
- Check server logs for backend errors

### Activity Logs Not Showing
- Logs are created automatically
- Check if user has any changes
- Only last 50 activities are shown
- Older logs exist in database but aren't displayed
