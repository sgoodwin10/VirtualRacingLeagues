Read #$ARGUMENTS. Understand the plan, and ask questions if needing clarification. Research the codebase as needed to understand the files and functionality. 
Explain what the feature is, and then plan for the build. 
Any questions should be asked one by one.
Create 3 documents - one for the overview, one for front end and the other for backend. Create the files in the same directory as the `read` file above.
Suggest what agents you will use to implement. Confirm before implementing.
Use the @agent-dev-be, @agent-dev-fe-app, @agent-dev-fe-public and @agent-dev-fe-admin agents as needed.
IMPORTANT: DO not write, edit or delete any code. This is only the planning phase.
