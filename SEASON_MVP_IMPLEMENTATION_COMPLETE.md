## 5. Architecture & Design Patterns Followed

### 1. **Component Composition Pattern**
- All components follow Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup lang="ts">`
- Reusable common components: DrawerHeader, FormLabel, FormError, ImageUpload, BasePanel
- Props down, events up data flow
- Type-safe emits and props

### 2. **State Management Pattern**
- Pinia stores for global state (seasonStore, seasonDriverStore)
- Local component state for UI interactions
- Computed properties for derived state
- Actions for async operations

### 3. **Service Layer Pattern**
- Services handle API communication only
- No business logic in services
- FormData builders for file uploads
- Response unwrapping and error handling

### 4. **Validation Pattern**
- Composables for reusable validation logic
- Reactive error objects
- Field-level and form-level validation
- Clear error/validate methods

### 5. **UI/UX Patterns**
- Drawer for forms (bottom position, 50vh height)
- Dialogs for confirmations and small forms
- Skeleton loaders for loading states
- Empty states with clear call-to-action
- Toast notifications for feedback
- Status badges with semantic colors

### 6. **TypeScript Patterns**
- Strict mode enabled
- Interfaces for all data structures
- Type guards and type assertions
- Generic types for composables
- Proper null handling

## 9. Testing Strategy (Ready for Implementation)

### Service Tests (Not yet written)
- `seasonService.test.ts` - Test all API endpoints, FormData building
- `seasonDriverService.test.ts` - Test all API endpoints

### Store Tests (Not yet written)
- `seasonStore.test.ts` - Test state updates, getters, pagination, filters
- `seasonDriverStore.test.ts` - Test dual-list management, stats updates

### Composable Tests (Not yet written)
- `useSeasonValidation.test.ts` - Test all validation rules
- `useSeasonDriverValidation.test.ts` - Test validation rules

### Component Tests (Not yet written)
- `SeasonFormDrawer.test.ts` - Test form rendering, validation, submission
- `SeasonDriverManagementDrawer.test.ts` - Test two-panel layout, add/remove operations
- `SeasonCard.test.ts` - Test rendering, navigation
- Additional component tests for all 10 components

**Note:** Test files not written yet, but all components are structured for testability following existing patterns (e.g., `CompetitionFormDrawer.test.ts`, `DriverTable.test.ts`)

---

## 10. Critical UI/UX Features

### 1. **Logo Inheritance**
- Shows competition logo by default
- "Upload Custom Logo" option
- Clear indication of which logo is in use
- Remove custom logo to revert to competition logo

### 2. **Status Badges**
- Setup: gray (secondary)
- Active: green (success)
- Completed: blue (info)
- Archived: orange (warn)
- Consistent across all components

### 3. **Confirmations**
- Name change: Shows old/new URL comparison
- Delete season: Two-step with "DELETE" text confirmation
- Archive: Single confirmation
- Remove driver: Single confirmation
- Status changes: Single confirmation with descriptive messages

### 4. **Empty States**
- No seasons: "No seasons yet. Create your first season to get started."
- No drivers: "No drivers assigned to this season yet."
- All drivers assigned: "All league drivers are already in this season."
- Helpful call-to-action buttons

### 5. **Loading States**
- Skeleton loaders (3 cards) for initial load
- Button loading indicators during actions
- Table loading states (PrimeVue built-in)

### 6. **Responsive Design**
- Drawer adjusts to screen size (50vh height, 75vh for driver management)
- Grid layouts: 1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop
- Tables scroll horizontally on mobile
- Touch-friendly buttons and interactions

---

## 11. Browser Compatibility

All components use:
- Vue 3 Composition API (modern browsers)
- PrimeVue 4 (supports modern browsers)
- Tailwind CSS 4 (modern browsers)
- TypeScript (compiled to ES2020)

**Supported Browsers:**
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

---

## 12. Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented:
1. **Lazy Loading:** Season detail route is lazy-loaded
2. **Debounced Slug Check:** 500ms debounce to reduce API calls
3. **Pagination:** All tables paginated (10/25/50 rows)
4. **Component Lazy Loading:** Large components imported on-demand
5. **Computed Properties:** Used for derived state to avoid re-computation
6. **Reactive State:** Minimal reactivity overhead

### Bundle Size Impact:
- **New Components:** ~30KB gzipped (estimated)
- **New Dependencies:** None (uses existing PrimeVue, Pinia, VueUse)

---

## 13. Accessibility (A11Y)

All components include:
- ✅ Semantic HTML5 elements
- ✅ ARIA labels on interactive elements
- ✅ Keyboard navigation support (PrimeVue built-in)
- ✅ Focus management (dialogs, drawers trap focus)
- ✅ Color contrast compliance (status badges, buttons)
- ✅ Screen reader support (descriptive labels)

---

## 14. Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

These features are NOT required for MVP but can be added later:

### Phase 2 Enhancements:
1. **Bulk Driver Operations:** Add multiple drivers at once
2. **Driver Import:** CSV import for season drivers
3. **Season Templates:** Create seasons from templates
4. **Season Duplication:** Duplicate existing season
5. **Advanced Filters:** Filter seasons by date, status, car class
6. **Season Stats Dashboard:** Comprehensive statistics view
7. **Season Export:** Export season data to CSV/PDF
8. **Season Archive Restore:** Restore archived seasons

### Testing Enhancements:
1. **Component Tests:** Comprehensive Vitest tests for all components
2. **E2E Tests:** Playwright tests for full user flows
3. **Visual Regression:** Percy/Chromatic for visual testing
4. **Performance Tests:** Lighthouse CI for performance monitoring

---

## 15. Backend API Assumptions

This frontend implementation assumes the following backend API endpoints exist:

### Season Endpoints:
- ✅ `GET /api/competitions/{id}/seasons` → PaginatedSeasonsResponse
- ✅ `GET /api/seasons/{id}` → Season
- ✅ `POST /api/competitions/{id}/seasons` → Season (multipart/form-data)
- ✅ `PUT /api/seasons/{id}` → Season (multipart/form-data)
- ✅ `POST /api/seasons/{id}/archive` → Season
- ✅ `POST /api/seasons/{id}/activate` → Season
- ✅ `POST /api/seasons/{id}/complete` → Season
- ✅ `DELETE /api/seasons/{id}` → void
- ✅ `POST /api/seasons/{id}/restore` → Season
- ✅ `POST /api/competitions/{id}/seasons/check-slug` → SlugCheckResponse

### Season-Driver Endpoints:
- ✅ `GET /api/seasons/{id}/drivers` → PaginatedSeasonDriversResponse
- ✅ `GET /api/seasons/{id}/available-drivers?league_id={id}` → PaginatedLeagueDriversResponse
- ✅ `POST /api/seasons/{id}/drivers` → SeasonDriver
- ✅ `PUT /api/seasons/{id}/drivers/{driverId}` → SeasonDriver
- ✅ `DELETE /api/seasons/{id}/drivers/{driverId}` → void
- ✅ `GET /api/seasons/{id}/drivers/stats` → SeasonDriverStats
